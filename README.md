# MFD Code Quality

This module provides a set of code quality methods.\
Installing this package will also **add the corresponding executable files to your environment**, allowing you to run each code quality check with a simple command-line call.

## Usage

![](docs/code_quality_demo.gif)

When installing `mfd-code-quality` package all these commands will become available from command-line - in the same way as `pip` for example.\
So you can just type i.e. `mfd-help` in your terminal without a need to call it from Python.\
If command requires configuration, such config will be automatically created and removed after.

### Available commands

| Command                        | Description                                                                                   |

### Available arguments (for all commands)

* `-p` / `--project-dir` - path to the root directory (default: current working directory)

* `-v` / `--verbose` - enable verbose output

### Configuration files

We are using 2 configuration files (created/modified/removed automatically):

* `ruff.toml` - for ruff configuration

* `pyproject.toml` - for project/generic configuration

### Custom configuration

Some modules have custom configuration files. Files are stored in `mfd_code_quality/code_standard/config_per_module` directory. Configuration files are merged with generic one during configuration process.
